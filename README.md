# Citizen Developer Meetup Group
A HTX initiative by developers for developers, making coding fun!

# About
The Citizen Developer meetup group is organise to grow interest in coding covering a broad range of topics from lo-code, scripting languages, compiled language to domain specific ones. It is not so much about what lanugages, but what problem we can solve with coding skills.

In this repo, we will share projects to enable people to create apps to solve their day-to-day problem.

## Connect with Us
For now, we are only on GitHub, once we grow the community to we hope to run an active discord channel.
