# Citizen Developer Meetup Group
A HTX initiative by developers for developers, make coding fun and accessible to everyone! You can developer and be part of our **#MakeYourOwn** movement.

## About
The Citizen Developer meetup group is organise to grow interest in coding covering a broad range of topics from lo-code, scripting languages, compiled language to domain specific ones. It is not so much about what languages, but what problem we can solve with coding skills. Whether you are Noob or Pro, join us to learn and contribute.

In this repo, we will also share projects that enable people to create apps to solve their day-to-day problem.

## Happenings
We will be running monthly meetups (1st Thu or Fri of every month) to share and demonstrate practical examples to help you develop basic coding skills that can be applied to your daily tasks - be it for work or for personal use. The sharing will be done by eXponents, friends of eXponents and friends from the industry. Importantly, you can to hang out with fellow citizen developers, share ideas and chill over drinks and snacks (when the situation allows).
